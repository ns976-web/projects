arduino code i've written for cervicheck.
note that for any given file, i have not necessarily written all of the code 
(as cervicheck is a collaborative effort where many of us edit the same file, and it is hard to tell who has written what).
all code in the master-gui file pertaining to serial communication is mine. 
the search code in impedance.ino is also mine.
